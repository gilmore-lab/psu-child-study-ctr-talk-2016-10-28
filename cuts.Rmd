##

- "Active" curation not-standardized
- Lots of data repositories, but no "databservatories"
- Hard to link data across time, space (location), individuals, tasks/measures

## Questions to ponder

- What data about your question of interest can't/don't you collect but others might?
- Who owns the data you collect?

| Phase      | Problem                  | Solution      |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Recruiting | Diversity, sample size   | FIRSt -> MeeSearch |
|            | Permission to share/link | Databrary policies |
| Collection | Non-electronic, formats  | PSU expertise in EMA |
|            | Geo-, other metadata     | MeeSearch     |
|            | Reproducible methods     | Video         |
| Curation   |                          |               |
|            | Non-reproducible workflows | RStudio, Jupyter |
| Publication | Hard to share data + workflows | DOIs   |
| Visualization |                       | Databservatory |
| Discovery |                           | Databservatory |

## Databservatory

- Studies
    + Measures of People in Settings by Researchers
- Measures
    + Spatial/temporal resolution
    + e.g., questionnaires vs. EEG
- People
    + Personal, family, (friend?) characteristics
- Settings
    + Places, times
